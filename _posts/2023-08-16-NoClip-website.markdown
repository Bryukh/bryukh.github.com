Recently, I came across a fascinating website called [noclip.website](https://noclip.website/). It's a collection of game levels from various games, and you can explore them in a "noclip" mode. It's a great way to appreciate the level design and art of games. The site has existed for several years and has an impressive collection of classic game levels. I spent an hour just exploring and discovering new things for the Dark Souls level. 

This website is an excellent tool for level designers and game developers. You can learn a lot from the games you love, especially as old games had to rely more on level design than graphics. So there are so many small details and tricks to learn from. Also, it's a great way to appreciate the work of game developers and artists. Plus, learn about the history of video games.
