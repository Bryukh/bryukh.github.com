I'm happy to announce that our proposal for the Connected Learning Summit 2023 was accepted. My friend Bobby Lockhart and I will present a showcase on the topic "The Power of Multiplayer Learning : Coding in the Metaverse". We will tell about our experience teaching coding in the Roblox metaverse and how we use multiplayer learning to make it more engaging and effective. In this showcase, we will share the challenges we faced and how we overcame them from the education game design side. We will also share our experience of using Roblox as a platform for teaching coding and how we use its "multiplayer everywhere" feature to put game-based learning to the next level.
