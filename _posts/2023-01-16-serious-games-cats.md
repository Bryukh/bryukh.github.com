One type of serious game those are trying to accept the public attention to some problems around us and make the world better this way. It doesn't mean the such game should be too "serious" and forget about the engagement. Vice versus -- such games should be interesting as a game so people play them and creators can tell people some story and get players' eyes on something ignored. It's not necessary should be a huge problem and save the world; it can be anything that makes the world better. For example, the game studio [Devcats](https://www.devcatsgames.com/) and their games about cats. Their games are trying to raise awareness of adoption and saving pets. Through the game, you can see a message from the creators about how we can help cats and maybe help some of them. Not all heroes wear capes, and you can make the world a little better place through games.
