Just finished 'Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software' by Charles Petzold, a book that's been on my virtual shelf for years. Initially, I expected insights into programming paradigms, but the book pleasantly surprised me. Petzold uses familiar concepts to unravel the complexities of computer science. However, the transition from simple ideas to intricate schemes of low-level logic and assembly instructions can be a bit abrupt. For those not deeply into tech, some sections might seem overwhelming – it’s okay to skip a few pages.

As a telecommunication engineer (as its written in my diploma), I found this journey back to my university days, revisiting electric circuits and digital processors, extremely enriching. The book brilliantly ties together various concepts, showing their interconnections and evolution.

One aspect, though, felt confusing – the 'difficulty curve' of the book. It's like a rollercoaster, swinging from basic to 'wow, this is tough.' It made me think: could this material be restructured into a more traditional, gradual 'saw' difficulty curve typical in game design? It's fascinating to view literature through a game designer's lens, always considering how to balance challenge and learning progression.
