Embracing constraints can lead to game-changing design. One of the best examples of such games is "Into the Breach" by Subset Games. Constraints drive creativity and innovation, pushing you to think outside the box and explore new boundaries. Consider constraints as a launchpad for your imagination - they challenge you to break the mold and elevate your game design. In this presentation, Subset Games will discuss how they used constraints to create the award-winning strategy game, Into the Breach. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend watching the video below.
