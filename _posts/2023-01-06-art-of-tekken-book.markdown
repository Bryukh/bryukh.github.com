One more book from the "Art of ..." series, and this time it's "Art of Tekken". For me Tekken and Tekken 2 are games somewhere near Mortal Kombat first 3 games -- so many hours spent there with friends. Tekken 2 was a revolution for us with its counterattack and combos. However, other Tekken games passed by me. So I was curious to read about the history of the game and the development process. The book is full of beautiful artwork and screenshots. It's a great book for any Tekken fan. My only concern is why the author didn't include references to the characters and where "their roots" as you easily can recognize the character inspiration from other games and real life. For example, Marshal Law or Raven. I think it would be great to have a short description of the characters and their origins. Anyway, it's a solid book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of game development and the art of video games.
