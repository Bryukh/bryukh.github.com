So my last weekend game is ... surprise, surprise... Baldur Gates 3, and before you stop reading this post as "one more review, omg", this post is not about BG3. Instead, it's about a peculiar déjà vu I experience when playing party CRPGs. Disclaimer: I love this genre, and Eye of the Beholder, Neverwinter Nights, and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura are among my favorite games of all time. Let's look into those games closer and you get my point.

You know the drill: Assembling a diverse team, handling their quirks and temper, trying to keep fire and ice in one room, keeping the team alive and managing resources, and making tough decisions. Add reading a lot of in-game and game rules (DnD, Pathfinder, etc) docs to optimize the team efficiency. Plus, you are not a manager but a leader and need to be in the front line and fight with your team together. Sound familiar? That's because it mirrors the life of an IT team lead! 

It's uncanny. And maybe that's why, when diving into games like BG3, I lean towards "story" difficulty, enjoy the deep and complex world, appreciate level design, and dive into the story. What about you? Does anyone else feel their job eerily echoing in a game genre or a particular game?
