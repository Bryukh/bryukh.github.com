This year I got interesting stats from Steam about my playing in 2022. Even if it's only steam games where I mostly play indie games, one of the diagrams took my attention -- the spider graph of most played tags. So my top three are Deckbuilding, Education (what's the surprise ;-) ), and Metroidvania (yes, my favorite). Now I can't get rid of constantly thinking about what the game can be if we combine all those three genres.
Educational Deckbuilding Metroidvania -- sounds interesting, right? I think I'll try to make a prototype of such a game. Maybe it will be a good idea for a game jam.
