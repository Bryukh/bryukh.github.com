Let me introduce another game todayâ€”this time, not an educational one. Well, you know my stanceâ€”ALL games are educational in some way, and this one is no exception.
I've been living in Serbia for almost three years now, and I've been closely following the Serbian game dev scene. There's no shortage of talented developers, designers, and incredible studios here.
Now, onto the gameâ€”Somber Echoes by Lav Games Studio. A dark-fantasy Metroidvania rooted in ancient Greek mythology? That's a combo I couldn't ignore. I'm a huge fan of Metroidvania games (only Metrobvania ranks higher for me!). And here's where that educational aspect sneaks inâ€”mythology is a fantastic way to introduce players to ancient stories, cultures, and legends.
Let's support these talented developers! Adding Somber Echoes to your Wishlist helps them a lot. I truly believe the Serbian game industry has massive potential, and I'm excited to see what surprises are coming next.
