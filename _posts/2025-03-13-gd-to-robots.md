When you see news about layoffs in the gaming industry, you start thinking what is plan B for us.
Plan B doesn't mean you need to pivot 100% into something new -- you can find a new hobby which can be your new job.

I started digging in my tech stack and experience and of course child dreams. 
With my experience with hardware, software engineering and game simulations I started to look into Robotics.
Especially nowday there is a huge area of Robotics about simulations and making software for robots.
Talking with my friends (who are working in Robotics) I found out that there is a huge demand for software engineers in this field.
I started to look into it and found there are so much collisions and analogues with game development.
Adding here my love for simulations and robotics I think I've found a new hobby for me which can be my new job.

I started to look some courses, digging ROS, refreshing my knowledge in C/C++ and need to wipe dust from my hardware and soldering skills.
Please, recommend me courses, books, resources or anything that can help me to get started.
