One of the most rewarding moments in game development is when you reach the stage where everything starts to come together. You've got your tools, assets, and environment in place—that's when the real magic begins. It's the moment you start populating your worlds with monsters and heroes, building towns and dungeons, setting up skills and perks, and so much more. I love that feeling when you arrange the building blocks, place the spawners, set key points, and then press "PLAY." Suddenly, the world you've been working on comes to life. I never tire of that moment.

Of course, there's a long journey to get there and countless hours that your team has invested to make this magic happen. And that only makes the satisfaction of pressing the "PLAY" button even sweeter.

P.S.: The pictures are from our game, CodeCombat Worlds on Roblox, featuring a new area—more slimes to defeat with your brave pets and smart coding!
