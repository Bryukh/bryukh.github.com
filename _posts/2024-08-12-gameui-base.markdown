UI and UX are challenging aspects of game development and crucial to the player experience, as they are among the most frequently interacted-with elements in a game. Small teams often need help to afford dedicated UI/UX designers, leaving this responsibility to game designers and developers. In such cases, I recommend sticking to best practices and familiar UI/UX patterns, even if they aren't perfectâ€”players will recognize them. An invaluable resource for this is the Game UI Database by Edd Coates. This essential tool saves hours of searching for examples and provides quick references to help persuade stubborn developers with examples from other games.
