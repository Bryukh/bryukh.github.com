Usually I don't play just one game at time. I have "active" game (playing it right now), "service" game (playing it from time to time by short sessions as Fortnite, WildRift, Diablo) and "puzzle" game(s) (1-2 level per day as brain warm-up/down). Often the active games move to "puzzle" category. So my last such game is Patrick's Parabox. This is a puzzle game with a unique recursive system of boxes within boxes within boxes or boxes out of boxes up to infinity. It's a mind-bending journey that pushes the boundaries of traditional puzzle-solving, asking you to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other. Technically you are a box there too, so all rules applies to the avatar.

The game offers over 350 meticulously hand-crafted puzzles, splitted by section which introduces new mechanics and twists. The game is not just about having fun â€“ it's also educational. The game offers a unique, interactive way to understand complex concepts like recursion, space paradoxes, and abstract thinking. As a player, you're not just passively consuming these ideas, but actively engaging with them, experimenting, and seeing them in action.

I've completed the main part of the game and now I'm playing the challenge levels. One, two per day, sometimes a level take more than a day. I'm trying to prolong the game as much as possible even slowly moving to 350/350. If you like puzzle games this one is a must-try.
