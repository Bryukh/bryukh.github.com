I just finished reading "Drawing Basics and Video Game Art: Classic to Cutting-Edge Art Techniques for Winning Video Game Design" by Chris Solarski. As a game designer and developer I was looking for a book that would give me a general idea of what goes into creating video game art. The author does an amazing job of exploring the connections between classical art and video games, and gives readers an introduction to basic and advanced drawing and design skills. He also provides detailed instruction for using these methods to design complex characters, worlds, and gameplay experiences. One of the main takeaways for me was that video game art is an evolution, not a revolution. It's amazing to see how the medium has progressed and evolved over time. 

Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone working in the video games industry or anyone interested in learning more about the artistic side of game design. It's accessible, informative, and a great way to expand your knowledge of gaming's future and potential as an artistic medium.
