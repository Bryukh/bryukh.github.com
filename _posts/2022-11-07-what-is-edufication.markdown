Edufication is one more way to combine games and education with Gamification and Game-Based Learning.
Edufication is using educational elements in non-educational contexts. Like Gamification, Edufication is an additional layer, and removing it won't break the core product. Usually, Edufication is used for video games, but it can be used for any other product as board games or even sports. Edufication is a simple way to create educational games based on existing successful and familiar for players/students titles. It's a good way to develop educational games for gamers.

The main difference between game-based learning and edufication in games is that an educational mechanic isn't in the core loop even. So you remove that Edufication layer and the games may change a little but still remain the same in the core. That's the main difference between game-based learning and edufication in games. I don't want to say it's a bad practice -- I think it's a good way to create educational games based on existing successful and familiar game mechanics for students. Plus, Edufication allows quickly changing the educational content without changing the game mechanics.

Of course, there are some downsides to Edufication. Maybe, next time I'll write about them.
