There are a few things that I absolutely love: Game Design, books, and puzzles. The latest Humble Bundle is a combo of all three!
It's packed with ebooks to level up your board game and puzzle design skills. Twenty-three books, including "Think Like a Game Designer" by Justin Gary and "Puzzlecraft" by Mike Selinker, Thomas Snyder, and many more.

The best part is that it's all for a good cause. Pay what you want and support Active Minds, a commendable organization working tirelessly for mental health. Sadly it is time-limited, so don't kick me too hard if an algorithmic feed shows you this post after the bundle ends.
