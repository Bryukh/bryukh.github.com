Another type of serious game that can be used in education is simulation games or "God games," where the player has god-like powers to affect weather, change the environment, and maybe even physics laws. One such game is "Terra Firma". This is an excellent example of a simulation game that can be used in education. It allows players to explore and manipulate the forces of nature in a simulated world and see the impact of their actions on the environment. It can be used to teach students about a variety of subjects, such as geology, ecology, and environmental science. The game is in early access; however, I seriously recommend looking at this game if you are using games in the education process.
