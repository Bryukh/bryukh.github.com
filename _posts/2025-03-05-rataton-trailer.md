Memory unlocked – PS Vita and the one game I had: Patapon. Let’s be honest – I don’t usually like music games, but Patapon was an exception. I was sooo bad at it, yet I never gave up. The magic of inspiring those little warriors with the rhythm of drums, and the simple control with just 4 buttons, was irresistible. I couldn’t stop chanting, “Pata pata pata pon!”

Now it’s 2025, and the successor to Patapon is almost here – Ratatan! Soon, we’ll hit battle drums and lead armies of cute characters against the Darkness. Yes, we’ve seen it before, but how can we resist when the battle drums call – Yaha Yaha Yaha Hoy!
