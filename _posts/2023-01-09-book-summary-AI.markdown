As a passionate reader, I completely understand the desire for a service that provides summaries of books, especially for those that are part of a series. However, keeping track of all the plot points and characters can be challenging, especially as the series progresses. One potential solution to this problem could be an AI-powered service that allows users to upload a book or connect their Kindle account and generates a summary of the key plot points and characters. This could be a valuable resource for readers looking to refresh their memory or get caught up on a series they may need to catch up on. While I have yet to learn of any service like this currently available, it is certainly an idea worth exploring further. If anyone is aware of a service like this, please feel free to share it in the comments.
