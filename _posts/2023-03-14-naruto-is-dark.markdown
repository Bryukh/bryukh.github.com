This year, I decided to reread and complete the entire Naruto saga. I read it many years ago and remembered it as a great story about ninjas, superpowers, magic, and willpower. But I didn't remember how dark it was. It's like "Battle Royale" where children have to fight each other to the death (the Chunin Exams are for 13-year-old Naruto). Most of the protagonists are orphans or have witnessed the cruel death of their relatives. Losing friends is an everyday occurrence, and wars are treated as commonplace. Even necromancy is just a common thing, and nobody seems to care. I'm wondering why I didn't notice it before. What other stories or books did you read as a child/teenager that you now see in a different light?
