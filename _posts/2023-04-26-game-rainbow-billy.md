Just stumbled upon an amazing game on Xbox Game Pass called Rainbow Billy: The Curse of Leviathan. Though the game appears casual and simple, it's a cute and colorful 2.5D Adventure-Puzzle-Platformer that not only provides hours of fun but also teaches kids (and adults!) about empathy, communication, and friendship skills. The game encourages non-violent problem-solving, making it a unique and wholesome experience for everyone. From the first few minutes, I expected a simple platformer for kids, but the game has a lot of depth and a great story. And the first "combat" encounter was a surprise - it's a narrative puzzle! I was expecting to fight the monster, but instead, I had to understand their intentions, fears, and motivations. The game is full of such encounters.

If you're looking for a game that can entertain and educate both kids and adults alike, I highly recommend giving Rainbow Billy: The Curse of Leviathan a try.
