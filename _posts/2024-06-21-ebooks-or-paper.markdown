Thanks to my grandfather, I started reading books early. I quickly completed most of the books in his library and became a regular visitor at my local library. However, growing up in a small town on the world's edge limited my choices.

When I moved to Moscow, things improved, but I still struggled to afford books from bookstores. Plus, bookstores often had a limited selection. This is one reason I switched to eBooks more than 20 years ago.

At first, I used Palm devices (remember those?), then the legendary PRS-500 (if you know, you know), and many other devices over the years. Don't get me wrong, I love paper books for their aesthetics, but when traveling, how many can you realistically take?

I always like to have a choice or be able to grab a book from a recommendation or a series. With eBooks, I can get almost any book in a very short time. Nowadays, a Kindle device is my constant companion.

What's your opinion about eBooks? Are you "only paper, only hardcore"?
