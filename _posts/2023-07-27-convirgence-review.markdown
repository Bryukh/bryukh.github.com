In a previous post, I mentioned the importance of lore in games and discussed how the 'Mageseeker' game is a testament to this. This time, I want to talk about 'Convergence' -- another game in the League of Legends universe. Both games feature familiar champions in direct action, the story, and cameo appearances. Plus, 'Convergence' introduces several heroes that you know from the famous 'Arcane' series. I'm not sure what Riot counts as canon for Zaun and Piltover. Still, I'm confident that 'Arcane' plus 'Convergence' is a good start for understanding the complicated relationship between the two cities.

From the game mechanics side, both 'Convergence' and 'Mageseeker' adopt a unique approach. They take a classical, proven set of mechanics and add a unique twist. In 'Mageseeker,' it's magic stealing, while in 'Convergence,' it's time travel. Time travel drastically changes fast-paced combat. It allows you to take risks and try different strategies, providing very short "what-if" scenarios. If you fail, you can always go back in time and try again. Of course, it's limited, and you're not invincible, but it's a good way to make a game more accessible to a wider audience while keeping the ultra-fast pace of the game.

'Convergence' is further proof of why it's important to expand your IP and the universe. Each new game strengthens the whole franchise and the connection with your players. After completing 'Convergence,' I couldn't resist reinstalling 'Wild Rift' on my tablet and trying new champions (I still prefer the Support Lane - Tanks and CC Enchanters are my favorites). And I'm sure I'm not the only one who did that.

So, I'm looking forward to seeing more games in the Runeterra universe. And I'm confident that that the Riot Forge program will not disappoint us. If you're looking for a good fast-paced platformer or want to try this genre, then 'Convergence' is a good choice. Thanks to Double Stallion and Riot Games for the game and the universe.
