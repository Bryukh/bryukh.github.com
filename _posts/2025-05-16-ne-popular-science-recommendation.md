The next Chinese Exam is coming, so I started taking more audition practice. Usually, I prefer some comedy series or movies for that; however, this time, I've found something even better.

I love popular science videos, even with the contradictory opinions of "true" scientists. However, those channels and shows give me more motivation to learn something new.
So, my search for some Chinese language content I've met [毕导THU Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thu4878). Not sure how effective it is for learning Chinese, as this guy is speaking too fast for me.
However, the quality and the content are something I've never seen before. 

And just to start, I recommend this video: [The World is Logarithmic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdhRD4TKh48) -- the mathematical view of many things in our world. Great attention to detail and the way of explaining is just excellent. Well, and if you support simulation theory, you will get one more argument, even if the author did not have such an intention.
