I wrote about 'The Talos Principle 2' two weeks ago and last weekend, I spent my time playing the game, solving its puzzles, and immersing myself in the philosophical debates between the characters—sentient robots. There are plenty of reviews out there, so I'll share my personal thoughts. The game isn't just a gaming experience; it's a philosophical journey. As the 1,000th robotic human in a post-human world, you navigate through ethical dilemmas and societal questions, all while solving complex puzzles. The choices you make lead to various outcomes, and they're more nuanced than simple binary decisions. If you've played the first game, you'll have some idea of what to expect. However, this time, you're not alone; you'll encounter many more characters as you try to resolve the world's dilemmas. A notable improvement is the environment—the areas and landscapes are mind-blowing, making TP2 a fantastic showcase for Unreal Engine 5. I highly recommend playing the game on a big screen for the full experience. If you're a fan of mind-twisting puzzles and philosophical fiction, then this game is a must-play. In my opinion, it's one of the best games of the year.
