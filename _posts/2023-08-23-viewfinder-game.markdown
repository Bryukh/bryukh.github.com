Recently, our Game Club delved into the world of "Viewfinder", and as first-person puzzler (with "Portal" and "Talos" are the best) fan, I was eager to dive in. The standout feature of "Viewfinder" is undeniably its groundbreaking mechanic that empowers players to alter their surroundings using photographs. The journey begins with a set of predefined images, but once you get your hands on the camera, the game truly comes alive. This ability to animate pictures and morph reality is not just a trick; it's a central gameplay element that continually evolves.

The aesthetics of the game are equally captivating. Depending on the style of the photographs or pictures you use, you can find yourself navigating a world painted in broad brushstrokes or sprinting through hand-drawn sketches. It's a visual treat that adds layers of immersion to the gameplay. However, every game has its flaws. While "Viewfinder" excels in mechanics and visuals, its narrative doesn't quite hit the mark. Set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic future, the story, though intriguing, is presented in a disjointed fashion, making it a challenge for players to engage with truly. The characters mostly lack depth, except for Cait, an adorable "cat" that remains a memorable highlight. 

Another weird thing is that for a small percentage of players, the game causes motion sickness, I'm one of them and tried to use different settings and advice from the developers, but it didn't help. I don't have problems with "virtual legs," usually, VR and FP games don't cause motion sickness for me, but this one did, so I could only play in small chunks and had to drop the game. So it's a good idea to try the demo first.
