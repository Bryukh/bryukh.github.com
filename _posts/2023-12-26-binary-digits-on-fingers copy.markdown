Recently, I've been engrossed in the book "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software." It sparked an interesting thought: what if humans had initially developed a binary number system (base 2) instead of the decimal (base 10) system? Consider this: with binary, you can count up to 31 on one hand and easily reach 1,000 using both hands. It would take a little while to become accustomed to this system and effortlessly recognize binary numbers. We wouldn't need to translate them, as binary would be our native numerical base.

Imagine the impact this change could have had on science and human history. Could we have advanced to modern engineering centuries earlier? And with such rapid technological progress, might we have seen the emergence of cyberpunk, steampunk, or other alternative technical societies before the world was ready? What are your thoughts?
