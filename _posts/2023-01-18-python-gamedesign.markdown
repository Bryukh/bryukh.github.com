Jupyter Notebooks is a popular tool for data analysis and scientific computing, however I'm using it as a tool for game design. Jupyter Notebooks can be a good replacement for traditional tools like Google Spreadsheets and Excel, as it allows for more dynamic and data-driven approach to game design. This can be especially useful for balancing and fine-tuning game mechanics. Jupyter Notebooks can be a great tool for game design as it allows for a more interactive and flexible approach to prototyping and testing game mechanics. It allows for quick iteration and experimentation with game mechanics, as well as visualization of the results. Using python helped me many times already in game design career, of course it's easier for me as I have a background in programming. But I think it's a good tool for game designers who want to learn programming or just want to use it for game design. Have you used these tools before in your game design process? Let us know in the comments!
