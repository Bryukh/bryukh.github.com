Three weeks of learning Robotics and Webots. Started with basic simulations and simple robot behaviors. The 3D visualization helps to understand how robots move and interact with their environment.

The Webots interface feels a bit clumsy compared to modern game engines. It's understandable given its specific purpose, but I'm thinking about trying Unity or another game engine for robot simulations later. The workflow and tools in game engines are just more polished and familiar.

Anyways, making simple robots in Webots is fun and feeling as a kid who just got new toys.

P.S. Got some parts and details to make an RC car, so the soldering part is coming soon!
