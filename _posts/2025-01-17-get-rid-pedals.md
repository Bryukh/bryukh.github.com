I recently read ["Take the Pedals Off the Bike"](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/take-the-pedals-off-the-bike/), which explores teaching kids to ride by removing the pedals so they focus on balance first. This idea is disputable even for cycling, but what if we applied it to video games?  

Many classics (Mario, Zelda, Minecraft) skip tutorials and let players learn by doing. But in educational games, especially in schools, we need structured scaffolding to guide learning.  
Yet, indie educational games have room to experiment. What if we designed learning experiences without hand-holding? Could we create more intuitive, discovery-driven games—or would this lead to frustration?  

Can scaffolding-free educational games work? Have you seen examples where this succeeds or fails?
