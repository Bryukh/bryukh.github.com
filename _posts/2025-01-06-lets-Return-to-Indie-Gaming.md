There’s something special about indie games — a spark of creativity, a touch of charm, and a refreshing sense of freedom that big-budget titles often lack. Recently, I’ve felt the need to step away from the usual gaming grind and find that joy again. I’m taking a break and heading back to the roots of gaming, where indie games shine the brightest. That idea is not mine — it was from the youtube channel [Clemmygames](https://www.thebestindiegames.com/).

#### Taking a Break from Freemium and Multiplayer

Freemium games and competitive multiplayer titles seem to dominate gaming these days. They can be fun and rewarding, no doubt. I’ve enjoyed my fair share of both. But lately, they’ve started to feel more like work than play. Freemium games bring endless dailies, weeklies, and events designed to keep you hooked, while multiplayer games often come with pressure and, let’s be honest, a fair amount of toxicity.

I don't judge -- after all I have been making as freemium as multiplayer competitve games too. These games have their place, and they can be amazing. But every now and then, it’s good to take a step back. Just like we need breaks from work, we need breaks from certain kinds of games to remember why we started playing in the first place.

#### Why Indie Games?

Indie games bring something different to the table. They’re often made by small teams or even solo developers, and they’re all about creativity, storytelling, and unique ideas. Without the pressure of giant budgets or market demands, indie developers can take risks and create games that feel deeply personal.

Think about the calming beauty of *Journey*, the heartfelt story of *Celeste*, or the strategic fun of *Slay the Spire*. These games remind us that gaming isn’t just about winning or climbing leaderboards—it’s about exploring, creating, and connecting with something bigger.

#### Shining a Light on Educational Games

One area where indie games truly stand out is in education. Most of the best educational games come from small, passionate teams who pour their hearts into making learning fun. Games like *CodeCombat*, *Human Resource Machine*, and *Kerbal Space Program* show how much potential there is when gaming meets education.

These games don’t always get the attention they deserve, but they’re changing how we think about learning. By blending gameplay with educational goals, indie developers are showing that learning doesn’t have to be boring. They’re paving the way for innovative approaches in classrooms and beyond. These games deserve more love—not just from players, but from educators and schools looking to inspire.

#### Rediscovering the Joy of Gaming

For me, going back to indie games isn’t just about playing different titles; it’s about finding that pure, simple joy in gaming again. Indie games cut through the noise and offer experiences that stay with you long after you’ve put down the controller. They’re perfect for quiet nights, moments of reflection, or just a break from the hustle of today’s gaming trends.

So, if you’re feeling burned out from the constant grind of freemium or multiplayer games, give indie games a shot. You might just fall in love with gaming all over again.
