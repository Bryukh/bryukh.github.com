Choosing a game to start when completing the previous one is not always an easy task. 
What about taking something AAA and trying to play it? Especially when it's in your backlog for years?
Ok, this one looks interesting and looks very polished after many patches. Futuristic setting, RPG mechanics, and a deep story. Sounds good.

I love complex RPGs, sci-fi books were always under my pillow, and the graphics look very polished.
So, let's start!

A few hours later, I got to the story, completed a few missions, got my first gear, and upgrades.
Everything looks good, and I should love this game, right?

But, I don't, I just feel uncomfortable, too many things remind me of the unpleasant side of reality and the future.
It's the case when "the problem is not you but me". I know, it sounds like a bad cliche for a broken relationship.
However, sometimes it just happens. You feel the game setting or the story is uncomfortable for you.
Maybe it's because of your previous experience or personal life traumas. It just happens.

There are many games that I am not playing even if I know they are really good.
But I know I won't enjoy them, just because some elements are uncomfortable for me.
I don't want my personal subjective "uncomfortableness" to put the great game as something not good in my game designer toolbox,
But I can't ignore it, I need to learn from the best game designers and developers, and make my own decisions.
Usually, in this case, I have to go to "soulless reviews" and deconstructs of these games. And leave these games in my special "maybe later" list.
I hope someday I will be able to play them and enjoy them.
