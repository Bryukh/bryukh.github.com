Edufication is one more way to combine games and education with Gamification and Game-Based Learning.
Edufication is using educational elements in non-educational contexts. Like Gamification, Edufication is an additional layer, and removing it won't break the core product. Usually, Edufication is used for video games, but it can be used for any other product as board games or even sports. Edufication is a simple way to create educational games based on existing successful and familiar for players/students titles. It's a good way to develop educational games for gamers.

The main difference between game-based learning and edufication in games is that an educational mechanic isn't in the core loop even. So you remove that Edufication layer and the games may change a little but still remain the same in the core. That's the main difference between game-based learning and edufication in games. I don't want to say it's a bad practice -- I think it's a good way to create educational games based on existing successful and familiar game mechanics for students. Plus, Edufication allows quickly changing the educational content without changing the game mechanics.

Of course, there are some downsides to Edufication. Maybe, next time I'll write about them.

One more book from the "Art of ..." series, and this time it's "Art of Tekken". For me Tekken and Tekken 2 are games somewhere near Mortal Kombat first 3 games -- so many hours spent there with friends. Tekken 2 was a revolution for us with its counterattack and combos. However, other Tekken games passed by me. So I was curious to read about the history of the game and the development process. The book is full of beautiful artwork and screenshots. It's a great book for any Tekken fan. My only concern is why the author didn't include references to the characters and where "their roots" as you easily can recognize the character inspiration from other games and real life. For example, Marshal Law or Raven. I think it would be great to have a short description of the characters and their origins. Anyway, it's a solid book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of game development and the art of video games.

[This lovely article](https://news.mit.edu/2023/roman-concrete-durability-lime-casts-0106) about the durability of Roman concrete attracted my attention as I like that period of history and its engineering side. However, this quote from the article is the most interesting for me:

> Previously disregarded as merely evidence of sloppy mixing practices, or poor-quality raw materials, the new study suggests that these tiny lime clasts gave the concrete a previously unrecognized self-healing capability.

Except it's a great example of how new research can change our understanding of the past, it can change our look at some usual things for us. For example, in game design and video games aspects, we often don't understand why a game is successful, or why we like it even it doesn't have the best game mechanics or is made so so on the first look. So maybe those games contain their own "tiny lime clasts" that give them the capability. And we can learn from them.

This year I got interesting stats from Steam about my playing in 2022. Even if it's only steam games where I mostly play indie games, one of the diagrams took my attention -- the spider graph of most played tags. So my top three are Deckbuilding, Education (what's the surprise ;-) ), and Metroidvania (yes, my favorite). Now I can't get rid of constantly thinking about what the game can be if we combine all those three genres.
Educational Deckbuilding Metroidvania -- sounds interesting, right? I think I'll try to make a prototype of such a game. Maybe it will be a good idea for a game jam.

As a passionate reader, I completely understand the desire for a service that provides summaries of books, especially for those that are part of a series. However, keeping track of all the plot points and characters can be challenging, especially as the series progresses. One potential solution to this problem could be an AI-powered service that allows users to upload a book or connect their Kindle account and generates a summary of the key plot points and characters. This could be a valuable resource for readers looking to refresh their memory or get caught up on a series they may need to catch up on. While I have yet to learn of any service like this currently available, it is certainly an idea worth exploring further. If anyone is aware of a service like this, please feel free to share it in the comments.

title:  The Value of LitRPG for Game Designers?
categories: books
tags: litRPG books videogames gamedesign inspiration gamemechanics

LitRPG is one of my favorite genres in fantasy. If you don't know, LitRPG is a subgenre of fantasy (or sci-fi) literature that combines elements of traditional fantasy with video game elements, such as RPG-style character development, leveling, and questing. It's a great genre for me as I love video games and fantasy. However, it's also interesting and useful to read from the game designer's point of view. Yes, as a game designer, you may often have "facepalm" moments when some game mechanics in books are so unbalanced or just wouldn't work in real games. However, the way that the characters interact with and manipulate these game systems can also offer inspiration for game designers. Especially when authors often put their characters in impossible situations for the plot, such as a mage without mana, a necromancer in a Light kingdom, player-as-NPC, and other weird classes and restrictions. In real games, it's not possible to have such situations, players probably just drop the game, but it's a great inspiration for game designers to think about how to make such situations possible in games. So, I would recommend reading LitRPG books for game designers.

Recently I've met an interesting game [Agents of Influence](https://www.altereainc.com/agents-of-influence) -- a spy-themed educational video game that teaches students how to recognize and combat the misinformation they encounter in their daily lives. I've played the prototype of the game and hope to see the whole game soon. It's a great example of an educational game that teaches important modern skills to question the trustworthiness of information and determine its trustworthiness in order to inform their decisions and build better information consumption habits. Kids and teenagers are surrounded by a titanic flow of information nowadays, and critical thinking and digital literacy are too important nowadays. 
I believe that this game will be an excellent tool for educators to help their students develop the skills they need to navigate the vast amounts of information they encounter on a daily basis. It is a great example of how educational games can be an effective way to teach students important skills in a fun and engaging way. I highly recommend giving it a try and seeing the impact it can have on your students' digital literacy and critical thinking skills.

For me, the first programmer's game was Colobot -- real-time strategy with 3D graphics. Players take on the role of an astronaut who must land on a planet and use robots to gather resources, construct buildings, and complete missions. It was Love at first sight -- cool video game with programming. For a long time, I was sure it was the first programmer's game at all (naive, I know). Later I'd found more and more programmer's games; however, it was a big surprise to know that one of the first programmer's games (maybe even the first one) was RobotWar, developed in the 70s and published in 1981. It's a text-based game where players control robots using a simple programming language to fight against each other. Overall, it's interesting to see the evolution of the programmer's game genre, from the early text-based games like RobotWar to titles like Colobot with advanced 3D graphics and complex programming languages to modern programmer's games.

One type of serious game those are trying to accept the public attention to some problems around us and make the world better this way. It doesn't mean the such game should be too "serious" and forget about the engagement. Vice versus -- such games should be interesting as a game so people play them and creators can tell people some story and get players' eyes on something ignored. It's not necessary should be a huge problem and save the world; it can be anything that makes the world better. For example, the game studio [Devcats](https://www.devcatsgames.com/) and their games about cats. Their games are trying to raise awareness of adoption and saving pets. Through the game, you can see a message from the creators about how we can help cats and maybe help some of them. Not all heroes wear capes, and you can make the world a little better place through games.

Another type of serious game that can be used in education is simulation games or "God games," where the player has god-like powers to affect weather, change the environment, and maybe even physics laws. One such game is "Terra Firma". This is an excellent example of a simulation game that can be used in education. It allows players to explore and manipulate the forces of nature in a simulated world and see the impact of their actions on the environment. It can be used to teach students about a variety of subjects, such as geology, ecology, and environmental science. The game is in early access; however, I seriously recommend looking at this game if you are using games in the education process.

Jupyter Notebooks is a popular tool for data analysis and scientific computing, however I'm using it as a tool for game design. Jupyter Notebooks can be a good replacement for traditional tools like Google Spreadsheets and Excel, as it allows for more dynamic and data-driven approach to game design. This can be especially useful for balancing and fine-tuning game mechanics. Jupyter Notebooks can be a great tool for game design as it allows for a more interactive and flexible approach to prototyping and testing game mechanics. It allows for quick iteration and experimentation with game mechanics, as well as visualization of the results. Using python helped me many times already in game design career, of course it's easier for me as I have a background in programming. But I think it's a good tool for game designers who want to learn programming or just want to use it for game design. Have you used these tools before in your game design process? Let us know in the comments!

An idle game, also known as incremental games or clicker games, is a genre of video games where players perform simple actions, such as clicking a button, to generate in-game currency. Most are math-heavy behind the fancy facade of "mine diamonds" or "defeat monsters." Some of them allow you to see formulas and the logic behind the game, while others are more abstract and don't show you the formulas. Recently I found a game that is different from the rest. It's called "IDLE Spiral," and the math logic is in front of you. This is a beautiful Idle game based on spirals and mathematics. Sounds boring and not pretty? Well, it's not. The game is very well designed, and the math behind it is very interesting. Plus, the visualization of the math is very well done, and the minimalistic design is pleasing to the eye. The only down point that the game is abandoned and not updated anymore (I hope it will change). But it's still a great game to play and learn about math.

This year, I decided to reread and complete the entire Naruto saga. I read it many years ago and remembered it as a great story about ninjas, superpowers, magic, and willpower. But I didn't remember how dark it was. It's like "Battle Royale" where children have to fight each other to the death (the Chunin Exams are for 13-year-old Naruto). Most of the protagonists are orphans or have witnessed the cruel death of their relatives. Losing friends is an everyday occurrence, and wars are treated as commonplace. Even necromancy is just a common thing, and nobody seems to care. I'm wondering why I didn't notice it before. What other stories or books did you read as a child/teenager that you now see in a different light?

As I've mentioned earlier, the Atari era passed me by, so I've been reading up on this console and its games. I was surprised to discover that there was an educational programming game in 1979 called "Atari BASIC Programming." It was designed as an educational tool to teach users the basics of programming using the Atari BASIC language. Players could create simple programs and games using two Atari keypad controllers with special overlays to show how to type the different commands and letters.

The game was innovative for its time, especially considering the constraints of the Atari 2600 hardware and the simplicity of the programming language itself. Nonetheless, Atari BASIC Programming was an early attempt to merge gaming and education, paving the way for future educational games and programming tools.

Here you can find the game's manual and the game's dump [](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-basic-programming_20194.html).

I can find educational aspects in any game; however, each time I enjoy as a kid, I found an educational game, especially in such genre as Idle/clicker. I've mentioned one recently, and today I want to talk about the game "Cell to Singularity" -- an idle clicker game where you start as a single-cell organism, upgrade your biology, intellect, and technology until you engulf an entire planet with a civilization on the brink of technological singularity. Each node in the game comes with a detailed description or/and short facts about the topic, providing players with a wealth of information on biology, evolution, history, dinosaurs, astronomy, and many other scientific fields. As players progress through the game, they learn about the different stages of evolution, from the very beginning of life on Earth to the hypothetical future beyond modern civilization. The game's attention to detail is impressive, with accurate scientific facts and information provided for each node. Players can learn about the different species of dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago, the various forms of life that inhabited the oceans, and the other branches of the evolutionary tree that led to the development of modern-day mammals and primates. In addition to its focus on biology and evolution, Cell to Singularity also introduces players to astronomy, allowing them to explore the cosmos and learn about the various planets and celestial bodies in our solar system. Different time events raise specific topics, for example, the history of money or Bees. Overall, Cell to Singularity is an excellent idle/clicker game that provides players with hours of entertainment and offers a unique learning experience.

Embracing constraints can lead to game-changing design. One of the best examples of such games is "Into the Breach" by Subset Games. Constraints drive creativity and innovation, pushing you to think outside the box and explore new boundaries. Consider constraints as a launchpad for your imagination - they challenge you to break the mold and elevate your game design. In this presentation, Subset Games will discuss how they used constraints to create the award-winning strategy game, Into the Breach.

I just finished reading "Drawing Basics and Video Game Art: Classic to Cutting-Edge Art Techniques for Winning Video Game Design" by Chris Solarski. As a game designer and developer I was looking for a book that would give me a general idea of what goes into creating video game art. The author does an amazing job of exploring the connections between classical art and video games, and gives readers an introduction to basic and advanced drawing and design skills. He also provides detailed instruction for using these methods to design complex characters, worlds, and gameplay experiences. One of the main takeaways for me was that video game art is an evolution, not a revolution. It's amazing to see how the medium has progressed and evolved over time. 

Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone working in the video games industry or anyone interested in learning more about the artistic side of game design. It's accessible, informative, and a great way to expand your knowledge of gaming's future and potential as an artistic medium.

Just stumbled upon an amazing game on Xbox Game Pass called Rainbow Billy: The Curse of Leviathan. Though the game appears casual and simple, it's a cute and colorful 2.5D Adventure-Puzzle-Platformer that not only provides hours of fun but also teaches kids (and adults!) about empathy, communication, and friendship skills. The game encourages non-violent problem-solving, making it a unique and wholesome experience for everyone. From the first few minutes, I expected a simple platformer for kids, but the game has a lot of depth and a great story. And the first "combat" encounter was a surprise - it's a narrative puzzle! I was expecting to fight the monster, but instead, I had to understand their intentions, fears, and motivations. The game is full of such encounters.

If you're looking for a game that can entertain and educate both kids and adults alike, I highly recommend giving Rainbow Billy: The Curse of Leviathan a try.

Imagine delving into a world where stealing magic is part of surviving – welcome to my weekend with Mageseeker, a riveting 2D action RPG with nostalgic pixel graphics. The game thrives on its unique mechanics and dynamic gameplay. Yet, without its setting in the vibrant world of Runeterra, the home of 'League of Legends' lore, I may not have started to play and completed the story (some boss battles are not hard but very annoying). Runeterra is the realm where most of the lore from the 'League of Legends' intellectual property unfolds. This familiarity caught my interest, compelling me to delve deeper into the world and characters I've grown fond of through other Riot Games' products (primarily Wild Rift).

Mageseeker, in my opinion, is testament to Riot Games' understanding of the significance of developing a distinctive universe and rich lore. Yes, it's a daunting task initially, demanding significant investment of effort. Furthermore, maintaining coherence between all lore elements to ensure a robust and consistent narrative is no easy feat. However, the dividends that this approach yields are invaluable. It adds depth to your games, making them more intriguing and distinguishable, thus facilitating discoverability for the players. When a well-crafted universe and compelling lore are layered atop solid game mechanics and gameplay, the end product can be extraordinarily powerful.
A case in point is 'Ruined King' -- another title set in Runeterra's world built on the mechanics from Battle Chasers. My initial interest in 'Ruined King' stemmed from its connection to Runeterra; I was eager to explore this world further. However, I soon discovered that it was a turn-based RPG, boasting excellent graphics and compelling gameplay.

This underscores my belief that investing time and resources in crafting a distinctive universe and lore might seem unnecessary from a short-term perspective. Yet, in the long run, it can offer manifold benefits, significantly enhancing your games' recognisability and popularity.

Three years ago, my friend and mentor @Brian Freyermuth recommended that I play "To The Moon", citing it as an exemplar of narrative game design. At first glance, it's a pixel art game with somewhat clumsy controls. There's no epic story, no world-saving quests, just an every day "protagonist" leading a common life. How could this make for a compelling story, let alone a game? I initially began playing, but then something distracted me, causing the game to retreat into the forgotten corners of my Steam library. Recently, I stumbled upon it again and decided to give it a second chance. 

Still absent of an epic story and filled with characters that mirror the everyday people we encounter, "To The Moon" presented one of the best narratives I've experienced. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, inspires, depresses, and most importantly, it prompts you to think about your life and the choices you've made. This tale of love, loss, and regret is profoundly human. The game medium enhances the story, providing an additional layer of interactivity that makes it more immersive and believable. I won't spoil the narrative here. Instead, I urge you to play it. It's a relatively short game, capable of being completed in 4-5 hours. I'm confident you'll love it just as much as I did.

categories: games

"The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante" is a narrative game that resembles a "choose your own adventure" interactive book. The story follows a person who dares to challenge the existing order in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed. Each choice has its consequences for your character, their family, and the Empire. Choices are never easy, and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey.

The game is a masterpiece of narrative design that made me reflect on my life choices. The first chapters, "Childhood" and "Adolescence," shape the character, immersing me in a whirlwind of thoughts and recollections about my bright childhood memories and how they influenced my personality. Some of my naive choices defined my subsequent decisions and impacted my life. Certain decisions strengthened my resolve, while others led to reevaluating my previous determinations. This game delves surprisingly deeper than I initially expected. Beyond the "interactive novella" facade, it's a game about life, choices, and their consequences. It exemplifies how interconnected we all are and how our choices affect others.

There is an interesting option for "hidden consequences," allowing you to play the game as an RPG and observe how each choice alters the character's "parameters." Alternatively, you can experience it as a book and simply savor the story. Both options are intriguing since they reveal different facets of the game. By choosing the former, I had moments where I made decisions that may have seemed "bad" for certain parameters, but they felt right for the character and myself.

In conclusion, I highly recommend playing "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante." This narrative gem offers an immersive and thought-provoking journey, where choices carry profound weight and consequences. Prepare to be captivated by its deep storytelling and reflective gameplay as you embark on an unforgettable adventure that will resonate long after the final page is turned.

In a previous post, I mentioned the importance of lore in games and discussed how the 'Mageseeker' game is a testament to this. This time, I want to talk about 'Convergence' -- another game in the League of Legends universe. Both games feature familiar champions in direct action, the story, and cameo appearances. Plus, 'Convergence' introduces several heroes that you know from the famous 'Arcane' series. I'm not sure what Riot counts as canon for Zaun and Piltover. Still, I'm confident that 'Arcane' plus 'Convergence' is a good start for understanding the complicated relationship between the two cities.

From the game mechanics side, both 'Convergence' and 'Mageseeker' adopt a unique approach. They take a classical, proven set of mechanics and add a unique twist. In 'Mageseeker,' it's magic stealing, while in 'Convergence,' it's time travel. Time travel drastically changes fast-paced combat. It allows you to take risks and try different strategies, providing very short "what-if" scenarios. If you fail, you can always go back in time and try again. Of course, it's limited, and you're not invincible, but it's a good way to make a game more accessible to a wider audience while keeping the ultra-fast pace of the game.

'Convergence' is further proof of why it's important to expand your IP and the universe. Each new game strengthens the whole franchise and the connection with your players. After completing 'Convergence,' I couldn't resist reinstalling 'Wild Rift' on my tablet and trying new champions (I still prefer the Support Lane - Tanks and CC Enchanters are my favorites). And I'm sure I'm not the only one who did that.

So, I'm looking forward to seeing more games in the Runeterra universe. And I'm confident that the Riot Forge program will not disappoint us. If you're looking for a good fast-paced platformer or want to try this genre, then 'Convergence' is a good choice. Thanks to Double Stallion and Riot Games for the game and the universe.

"It's the Matrix, but for locusts." -- the video title that Youtube suggested to me today, and as it was from one of my subscriptions, I could not resist watching it. The title is not clickbait, and this educational clip tells about the research at the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Konstanz, Germany.
The researchers are using simulated worlds to study locust behavior. The goal is to understand how locusts swarm and how to control these devastating swarms. The research is important because locusts are a significant threat to food security in many parts of the world. They can destroy entire crops in a matter of hours, and they're difficult to control because they're so mobile and can travel long distances.

Tom Scott is asking a good question about the ethical side of such research, even if just for insects. Won't it make us feel more comfortable doing the same to more intelligent creatures? As usual, if moving in small steps from insects to animals to humans, it's hard to notice the line where we should stop. Yes, I understand that it's a slippery slope argument, and the research is very important, but it's still worth thinking about.

The video has more interesting facts, so I recommend watching it. It's a good bite of knowledge for a lunch break.

About 10 years ago, I started working in #GameDev, specifically Educational Game Development. However, before that pivot, I had worked as a Software and Telecommunication Engineer for 10 years. This experience shaped my way of thinking and my approach to game development and game design. I've always been intrigued by the technical side of game design, constantly striving to make it more efficient and structured without losing the creativity and madness part. Throughout my career, I've used various programming languages, ranging from Pascal to C/C++/C#. However, one of my favorite languages is Python.

I don't use Python extensively on the game development engineering side (PyGame is good for learning but not suitable for production). But surprisingly, I've found that Python is a powerful game designer tool. It's easy to learn, simple to use, straightforward to share, and extremely powerful. The most apparent use case is Python for Game Analytics and processing data from players with Jupyter Notebooks. This was exactly how I started using it in my work to analyze the results of #AILeague for balancing. Subsequently, I began using Jupiter Notebooks for creating simple simulations with visualized results, then more complex simulations, and you can "loop" simulations->analysis to build the initial balance of games. It's a good replacement or addition to Excel/Google Sheets.

I plan to write a few articles about using Python for Game Designers, and I would like to know if that interests you. What topics would you want me to cover? Please, let me know in the comments.

Usually I don't play just one game at time. I have "active" game (playing it right now), "service" game (playing it from time to time by short sessions as Fortnite, WildRift, Diablo) and "puzzle" game(s) (1-2 level per day as brain warm-up/down). Often the active games move to "puzzle" category. So my last such game is Patrick's Parabox. This is a puzzle game with a unique recursive system of boxes within boxes within boxes or boxes out of boxes up to infinity. It's a mind-bending journey that pushes the boundaries of traditional puzzle-solving, asking you to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other. Technically you are a box there too, so all rules applies to the avatar.

The game offers over 350 meticulously hand-crafted puzzles, splitted by section which introduces new mechanics and twists. The game is not just about having fun – it's also educational. The game offers a unique, interactive way to understand complex concepts like recursion, space paradoxes, and abstract thinking. As a player, you're not just passively consuming these ideas, but actively engaging with them, experimenting, and seeing them in action.

I've completed the main part of the game and now I'm playing the challenge levels. One, two per day, sometimes a level take more than a day. I'm trying to prolong the game as much as possible even slowly moving to 350/350. If you like puzzle games this one is a must-try.

title: Competition in Classroom -- Double-Edged Sword
categories: education

Competition is a common tool in video games and esports and is often seen as a potential motivator in education. However, competition in the classroom is a double-edged sword.

On one side, leaderboards and rankings can ignite students' drive to learn, making education more engaging. But there's a risk. Students might shift focus from true learning to merely boosting scores, bypassing challenging tasks out of fear of losing points. This mentality can lead to an unhealthy learning environment where low performers may feel demotivated.

It's crucial to balance competition with the concept of 'productive struggle'. Instead of fearing mistakes, students should see them as opportunities for growth and learning. After all, education aims not to outscore each other but to cultivate individuals who continuously learn and grow. Can game-based learning help us achieve this goal and make the competition in the classroom a positive force?

categories: games

My current "session" game is WildRift. I like this fast-paced MOBA that I can play on my iPad and only need a short time to finish a match. 20-30 minutes is my ideal game time for a session. Looks good, right?
But there is one thing I don't like about this game: the community's toxicity. When I start a match, I do the same thing each time -- open the party screen, and mute everyone. Yes, theoretically, I would miss some important information from my teammates, but 95% (or even 99%) of it would be something like "jg diff," "report bot," or "noob mid." Those are not so bad; most of the time, it would be curse words, insults, and mentioning of all relatives. Even if it is not about me, I don't want to hear/read it. I seriously don't understand why RiotGames doesn't ban and punish this behavior. I tried to play with chat and report such behavior -- nobody cared, and most of the reports were without an answer. High ELOs are even worse, and people there are flaming and afk for any reason.

The worst part about this problem is that when I raise this topic in the game dev community, I often hear -- "It's MOBA; what have you expected? It's normal there and an important part of the game". Seriously? Everyone was new to any game; everyone had bad days when they play not good, and everyone can have a problem with the network. So if someone in your team is not playing well, you don't need to blame everyone and make this person feel bad. Instead of this you can try to help him, give some advice or just play your best and try to win. Flaming, blaming, and insulting never help you to win. Well, even defeat can teach you a lot, but not if you are busy typing long messages in chat explaining why their ego is more important than the game.

I've stopped to play WildRift several times and got back. I really like this game, but I don't like the community. So again and again, I start each match with the Open menu, mute, mute, mute, mute. I don't expect that this will change, but I hope that one day I will be able to play without this routine. Well, or at least -- RiotGames, please, add a "mute all" button to the game settings by default.

I'm happy to announce that our proposal for the Connected Learning Summit 2023 was accepted. My friend Bobby Lockhart and I will present a showcase on the topic "The Power of Multiplayer Learning : Coding in the Metaverse". We will tell about our experience teaching coding in the Roblox metaverse and how we use multiplayer learning to make it more engaging and effective. In this showcase, we will share the challenges we faced and how we overcame them from the education game design side. We will also share our experience of using Roblox as a platform for teaching coding and how we use its "multiplayer everywhere" feature to put game-based learning to the next level.

Recently, I came across a fascinating website called [noclip.website](https://noclip.website/). It's a collection of game levels from various games, and you can explore them in a "noclip" mode. It's a great way to appreciate the level design and art of games. The site has existed for several years and has an impressive collection of classic game levels. I spent an hour just exploring and discovering new things for the Dark Souls level. 

This website is an excellent tool for level designers and game developers. You can learn a lot from the games you love, especially as old games had to rely more on level design than graphics. So there are so many small details and tricks to learn from. Also, it's a great way to appreciate the work of game developers and artists. Plus, learn about the history of video games.

This past weekend, I delved deep into 'Crime O'Clock.' I first tasted this intriguing game about a year ago during "The Very Big Indie Pitch." In a rapid 10-minute presentation from the developers, the game's potential caught my attention with nice and clean art. Later, at the DevGAMM Awards 2022, I had the opportunity to play a more extended session. It felt a little raw back then, and the tutorial seemed complicated. Even though I rated it highly, I decided to shelve it for later exploration. The game had significant improvements and is now a polished product. Fast forward to now, and I've spent several engrossed hours in its world.

Think of 'Crime O'Clock' as a narrative-rich version of 'Where's Waldo?', but with multiple layers of time on a single map, many characters, and engaging mini-games. Add a sprinkle of humor here, and we get the perfect relaxation and mental diversion game. 

Games like 'Crime O'Clock' can be therapeutic. They offer a mental workout, honing our focus and providing a space for immersive, mindful engagement. While I've heard concerns about such games possibly unsuitable for those with ADHD, I'm not qualified to comment on that aspect. Nonetheless, this game could serve as a brilliant brain gym for many.

title: Dizzy Games - A Lesson in Game Design
categories: games

Growing up, many of us have been captivated by iconic games that have left a strong mark on our memories. For me, titles like HoM&M (2 and 3 are the best), Dune, Mario, Sonic, C&C, and many more immediately emerge. Yet, when I dive deeper into my gaming past, the magical world of "Dizzy" by Codemasters truly stands out. Those games featuring a clumsy egg as its protagonist was my first introduction to the intricate world of video game narratives. Despite its shortness by today's standards, "Dizzy" masterfully wove rich storytelling, humor, and challenging puzzles, igniting a lifelong passion for puzzle-solving within me.

The ZX-Spectrum (maybe you know it as Commodore 64) era was a unique time for gaming. The game challenges weren't just limited to the game's tricky puzzles only. No localization, unreliable tape records (that's how we loaded games), and bootleg copies (it was USSR, after all) made every gaming session an adventure in itself. Yet, the charm of "Dizzy" was irresistible. Even with its occasionally non-intuitive puzzles and the added language barrier, the determination to guide that charismatic egg through its quests never disappeared. The game's design was a testament to the power of perseverance and critical thinking, skills that would prove invaluable in later life. And while some titles in the "Dizzy" series deviated from the quest format and didn't leave as lasting an impression, "Dizzy III" and "Dizzy V" remain the best chapters of my gaming journey.

Reflecting on it now, as a game designer and developer, I realize the profound impact "Dizzy" had on my understanding of game design and engineering. It wasn't just a game; it was an interactive lesson in problem-solving, resilience, and the art of storytelling. It's fascinating to consider how such games, with their limited resources, could offer such deep educational value, subtly teaching us to think critically and approach challenges with tenacity. This makes me wonder: What games have shaped your perspective and left a mark on your memory? How have they influenced your learning and thinking processes?

So my last weekend game is ... surprise, surprise... Baldur Gates 3, and before you stop reading this post as "one more review, omg", this post is not about BG3. Instead, it's about a peculiar déjà vu I experience when playing party CRPGs. Disclaimer: I love this genre, and Eye of the Beholder, Neverwinter Nights, and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura are among my favorite games of all time. Let's look into those games closer and you get my point.

You know the drill: Assembling a diverse team, handling their quirks and temper, trying to keep fire and ice in one room, keeping the team alive and managing resources, and making tough decisions. Add reading a lot of in-game and game rules (DnD, Pathfinder, etc) docs to optimize the team efficiency. Plus, you are not a manager but a leader and need to be in the front line and fight with your team together. Sound familiar? That's because it mirrors the life of an IT team lead! 

It's uncanny. And maybe that's why, when diving into games like BG3, I lean towards "story" difficulty, enjoy the deep and complex world, appreciate level design, and dive into the story. What about you? Does anyone else feel their job eerily echoing in a game genre or a particular game?

Recently, our Game Club delved into the world of "Viewfinder", and as first-person puzzler (with "Portal" and "Talos" are the best) fan, I was eager to dive in. The standout feature of "Viewfinder" is undeniably its groundbreaking mechanic that empowers players to alter their surroundings using photographs. The journey begins with a set of predefined images, but once you get your hands on the camera, the game truly comes alive. This ability to animate pictures and morph reality is not just a trick; it's a central gameplay element that continually evolves.

The aesthetics of the game are equally captivating. Depending on the style of the photographs or pictures you use, you can find yourself navigating a world painted in broad brushstrokes or sprinting through hand-drawn sketches. It's a visual treat that adds layers of immersion to the gameplay. However, every game has its flaws. While "Viewfinder" excels in mechanics and visuals, its narrative doesn't quite hit the mark. Set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic future, the story, though intriguing, is presented in a disjointed fashion, making it a challenge for players to engage with truly. The characters mostly lack depth, except for Cait, an adorable "cat" that remains a memorable highlight. 

Another weird thing is that for a small percentage of players, the game causes motion sickness, I'm one of them and tried to use different settings and advice from the developers, but it didn't help. I don't have problems with "virtual legs," usually, VR and FP games don't cause motion sickness for me, but this one did, so I could only play in small chunks and had to drop the game. So it's a good idea to try the demo first.

When "Darkest Dungeon" first graced the gaming scene, it carved out a unique niche, championing the idea that "no punishment is reward." The flow of character deaths, the barrage of debuffs, and surviving a level with minimal setbacks count as success. The game got good reviews and a dedicated fanbase. So I  tried diving into its depths multiple times, only to resurface a few hours later, feeling unconnected. I chalked it up to "it's probably not my genre."

Fast forward to the release of "Darkest Dungeon 2." Admittedly, I almost overlooked it. However, the persistent news of positive reviews got my attention. This time, I approached it with a purely scientific interest, not as a player but as a game designer. To my surprise, 20 hours in, I was hooked! The sequel had transformed the experience. The introduction of rogue-like runs and diverse builds gave the game a fresh, engaging twist. It wasn't just a continuation; it was a reinvention.

This personal revelation led me to a broader reflection. How many potential masterpieces have I, or any of us, missed simply because the first installment didn't resonate? Game developers, like all artists, evolve. They learn, adapt, and refine. This year alone, with titles like Zelda, we've witnessed how a sequel can match and surpass its already exceptional predecessor. Perhaps it's time we, as gamers, embrace the idea of giving games, especially sequels, a second or even third chance. After all, in the realm of gaming, evolution is inevitable.

My first brush with gaming wasn't on the ZX Spectrum, but rather in video game clubs with Ataris (think arcades but with TVs and Atari bootleg versions). But the ZX Spectrum? That was my true introduction to the gaming world, and did it shape my life. Growing up during the USSR's turbulent times, the Spectrum was a beacon. It was affordable, hooked up to a TV, and ran games off tapes. And, well, let's just say copying those tapes was our version of "sharing" games. Piracy? We didn't even know the term back then. Well, and even if we did, we didn't have a choice to buy original games.

Those weren't high-end tapes, mind you. They taught me my first hardware tricks – like splicing and fixing tapes, and even tinkering with the tape recorders. And let's not forget, the ZX Spectrum wasn't just for games. It was my first dip into programming, trying to get that "Hello World" on screen without any guide to help. But, back to games. Those pixelated adventures, despite their technical constraints, were my gateway to so many genres. Puzzles, quests, and oh, Elite Dangerous? Countless hours spent star-hopping and trading. What was your first gaming platform, and how did it shape your world?

categories: games

As the launch of our new game looms closer, my gaming time has faded away (as has my social media activity). Big titles like BG3, AC6, and SF remain untouched on my shelf, silently beckoning for some attention. In the midst of this, I've found solace in "Marvel Snap" – a fast-paced mobile card game. While some purists in the CCG community might overlook it as casual, I'm convinced it stands as one of the most engaging mobile games of recent times. Its allure lies in the swift 3-minute matches, a layered meta, and the innovative snap mechanic, which collectively offer a depth that's both accessible and challenging. To be honest, the Marvel universe isn't my top pick, perhaps because of the prevalent "Marvel-fatigue" many of us are experiencing.

I like that I can play the game in short breaks while brewing my coffee, waiting for a bus, or between sets in the gym. Also, fast-paced doesn't mean you need 100% attention in the game -- 30-second intervals make it perfect for "play while doing something else". At the same time, I can sit down for long sessions when I want to climb in ranks and focus on Snap or Escape and choose decks based on the current meta. This balance makes it a game that feels just right, neither too brief nor too consuming. I would name this "exactly right size cake" game. I'm curious: are there other games out there that strike a similar balance?

Ah, the age-old debate of immersion and association in video games! First off, let me tip my virtual hat to Riot Games — their last #esport promotion video ["GODS ft. New Jeans"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3GouGa0noM) video is truly a feast for the eyes and shows an interesting phenomenon of how people see avatars and themselves in games.
The way we relate to our in-game avatars is a fascinating subject. It's like reading a book. Some people imagine themselves as the protagonist, feeling every emotion and every challenge as if it were their own. Others? They're just along for the ride, watching from a distance. My friend is one of those distant observers. To him, the idea of associating with a game character is some "selling game trick." He plays games and enjoys the story but never really "becomes" the character.

Me? It's a different story. When I play a game, I'm not just controlling a character; I am the character. Those dragons? They're not just pixels on a screen; they're MY dragons to slay. That space? It's not just a beautifully rendered backdrop; it's MY space to explore. And keep me from starting on emotional games. Games such as "This War of Mine" are just out of my scope as they can send me into a spiral of depression. The game is great and a piece of art, but I just can't play it.
Playing as a soulless villain in an RPG? Tried it. Couldn't do it. Every time I made a morally questionable decision, I felt like I was betraying... well, myself. It's not about the ethics of in-game decisions. I easily distinguish the game world from the real world. As a game developer and designer, I know that my game choices are just that: choices. It's about how those decisions make me feel as a player.

So, what about you? Where do you stand in this spectrum? Are you the distant observer, the immersed player, or somewhere in between? Do you think this association with game avatars is a marketing gimmick, or is it a genuine psychological phenomenon? Drop your thoughts below. And remember, there's no wrong answer.

Yesterday marked the launch of "CodeCombat Worlds" on the Roblox platform – an educational game that brings programming to life in a vibrant 3D universe. It's one of those experiences that's better felt than described. This project holds a special place in my heart, having donned multiple hats over the past 18 months, drawing from my diverse professional background and extending my "Jack of all trades" badge to Platinum.

This article is a reflection of my journey and the roles I've played in the development of this game. As the Lead Game Designer, I had the privilege to draft the game's vision and the overarching Game Design Document (GDD). Those initial moments, staring at a blank canvas and envisioning a universe, are truly magical. It's a time when possibilities are endless, and constraints haven't yet surfaced.

Once our game got the green light and budget allocation, I transitioned into the role of a System Game Designer and started to make game design docs for the game systems, features, mechanics, and everything that we would need later. This entailed diving deep into the nuances of Roblox, understanding its technical capabilities, and drafting detailed design documents for various game systems and mechanics. These documents not only crystallized our vision but also boosted our confidence. I think I've studied more Game Design books in this period than in my whole life. It is a great time on the edge between creativity and system thinking.

Thereafter, as our team was growing and roles are being filled, my journey saw me switching roles at a dizzying pace. From Game Designer to Level Designer, Art Director, Tech Artist, Technical Game Designer – the list goes on. This period was defined by intense collaboration and countless meetings. That is the best illustration that communications are a big part of the game designer's role.

Realizing the need for more engineering firepower \(surprise, surprise, you still need programmers to make a game ;-) \), especially given our ambitious goals. Our engineers made a new framework for the Roblox game and put a solid base for the game, but it also meant we could not use common patterns from the Roblox game dev. But as time has shown later, it was a very right decision. So, back to coding! I spent a decade as an engineer before venturing into game development, and game engineer is a familiar role. The learning curve was steep, with a new coding language, framework, and game engine. Admittedly, the pressure was immense, and I apologize to anyone I may have inadvertently upset during this phase.

![Engineer looks at the world](/assets/images/engineer%20look%20at%20the%20world.jpg)

The culmination of my dual roles as a designer and developer was most evident in the final months. While it might not align with the conventional "pipeline," my ability to design and implement simultaneously proved invaluable, especially when racing against time, as such a skill combo allows me to cut so many corners without creating serious tech and design debts.

The last stretch? Crunch time. Not mandated by some "evil CEO", but driven by our collective passion for the game. Vice versus even, and our boss persuaded us to slow down and not do berserker rushes. But we put so much into this game; we wanted to give our maximum for the result and be proud of that. It was hard, but in my memory, it's still "good fun times".

![engineer crunching](/assets/images/make%20crunching%20yourself.jpg)

We may have launched with less content than envisioned, but we've laid a strong foundation and a dedicated team that is ready to roll out more soon. As for what's next for me? I'm uncertain, and that unpredictability is precisely what makes the game development industry so exhilarating, especially when creating educational games that instill a sense of pride.

I've never really been into games like "Stardew Valley." Don't get me wrong, it's a solid game, and I've kept up with its news and design bits. It's just not my taste for crayons. But the game I do want to chat about? "Graveyard Keeper" by Lazy Bear Games. It's like a darker, medieval twist on Stardew Valley sprinkled with dark humor. Let's not get stuck comparing the two and dive right into Graveyard Keeper. It's all about managing your own medieval cemetery, getting into other gigs, and finding cheeky ways to save some coin. And with the dark humor bit? Yeah, you can guess what "saving coin" might imply. 😉

![Graveyard Keeper Poster](/assets/images/graveyard_keeper/graveyard-keeper-screenshot-river-corpse.jpg)


Visually? It's got that classic pixel vibe. Before you go, "Oh, another pixel indie game," hold up. Pixels might be a budget-friendly choice, but making them look good? Not a walk in the park. There's this weird spot where pixel art can look less retro and more... meh. With a game market overflooded by indie games, going pixel is a gamble. But Graveyard Keeper nails it. The moody dark colors and simple design vibe fit perfectly with the game's feel, giving it this unique atmosphere.

![Graveyard Keeper Screenshot Village](/assets/images/graveyard_keeper/graveyard-keeper-screenshot-village.jpg)

Speaking of which, what are the game's story and narrative? I must be honest: I was a little skeptical when I first started playing and was hit with the "lost memory" and "alternate world" cliches. How many times have we seen that plotline? So, after a few hours, the game truly began to stand out. It's brimming with dark humor that catches you off guard, sprinkled with just the right amount of self-mockery that makes you chuckle. And the best part? All the cheeky references and nods to other games, movies, and pop culture. The developers threw in a little something for everyone. So, for all easter egg hunters and detail fanatics, trust me, this game has layers. Dive in, and you'll discover a rich, engaging narrative full of surprises.

![Graveyard Keeper Screenshot Village](/assets/images/graveyard_keeper/graveyard-keeper-screenshot-npc.jpg)

There's a ton of content. At first, it seems straightforward, but soon, you're juggling loads of quests with their own tales. The NPCs? They're a breath of fresh air, breaking the mold with depth and unique stories. While you can stick to the main plot, I'd say dive into all the quests. Especially the one with the Inquisitor. And the best part? Multiple ways to reach the game's end. Plus, getting to the game end can be done in many ways, and you can choose your own path.
![Graveyard Keeper Screenshot Tavern](/assets/images/graveyard_keeper/graveyard-keeper-screenshot-tavern.jpg)

Now, the real gem? Gameplay. It's hard to sum up all the mechanics but trust me, there are loads. While the early game feels pretty chill, soon, you're swamped with choices on how to spend your time and resources. Farming, crafting, cooking, fishing, trading, exploring... you name it, it's there. And everything has its own depth and can be mixed and matched. Grow crops, turn them into food, then potions, then zombies... and that's just scratching the surface. And yeah, since it's a graveyard sim, expect a fair bit about the undead, some religious touches, and all that jazz.

Would I recommend it? Well, it's a mixed bag. I loved it and sank hours into it. But the sheer volume of stuff to do can be both a blessing and a curse. I kind of felt swamped in the later parts. If an overflowing to-do list isn't your thing, tread lightly. And heads up, it has a dark sense of humor, so if that's not your jam, you might want to skip it. But if you're game for something fresh, give it a go. It's on PC, Xbox, PS, Switch, and mobile. And if you're hooked, some DLCs keep you in the eerie world of Graveyard Keeper even longer.

I wrote about 'The Talos Principle 2' two weeks ago and last weekend, I spent my time playing the game, solving its puzzles, and immersing myself in the philosophical debates between the characters—sentient robots. There are plenty of reviews out there, so I'll share my personal thoughts. The game isn't just a gaming experience; it's a philosophical journey. As the 1,000th robotic human in a post-human world, you navigate through ethical dilemmas and societal questions, all while solving complex puzzles. The choices you make lead to various outcomes, and they're more nuanced than simple binary decisions. If you've played the first game, you'll have some idea of what to expect. However, this time, you're not alone; you'll encounter many more characters as you try to resolve the world's dilemmas. A notable improvement is the environment—the areas and landscapes are mind-blowing, making TP2 a fantastic showcase for Unreal Engine 5. I highly recommend playing the game on a big screen for the full experience. If you're a fan of mind-twisting puzzles and philosophical fiction, then this game is a must-play. In my opinion, it's one of the best games of the year.

I must confess, I hadn't played Alan Wake until just two weeks ago, right before starting the sequel. I'm a big fan of Remedy's games — Max Payne and Control are among my all-time favorites. But for some reason, I always avoided Alan Wake. Horror games and the need to use a flashlight in dark settings aren't really my thing. However, after hearing a lot of praise and having already bought the sequel, I decided to give it a try. The outcome was surprising, even to me.

Don't get me wrong — I love this game. I just can't pinpoint why. Each individual element seems just okay or even mediocre. The combat is annoying and repetitive. The environment, though meticulously crafted, is dark and unremarkable (yes, I played the original, not the remaster). The story is intriguing but leaves many questions unanswered. Yet, when these elements combine, they form a masterpiece. I couldn't stop playing until I finished it, and then I spent a lot of time reading about the lore and theories surrounding the story.

In my opinion, Remedy is one of the best game developers out there. They understand the importance of creating games with soul and depth. The shared universe concept only adds to a game that will be memorable for a long time. Now, it's time to start Alan Wake 2.

Recently, I've been engrossed in the book "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software." It sparked an interesting thought: what if humans had initially developed a binary number system (base 2) instead of the decimal (base 10) system? Consider this: with binary, you can count up to 31 on one hand and easily reach 1,000 using both hands. It would take a little while to become accustomed to this system and effortlessly recognize binary numbers. We wouldn't need to translate them, as binary would be our native numerical base.

Imagine the impact this change could have had on science and human history. Could we have advanced to modern engineering centuries earlier? And with such rapid technological progress, might we have seen the emergence of cyberpunk, steampunk, or other alternative technical societies before the world was ready? What are your thoughts?

Just finished 'Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software' by Charles Petzold, a book that's been on my virtual shelf for years. Initially, I expected insights into programming paradigms, but the book pleasantly surprised me. Petzold uses familiar concepts to unravel the complexities of computer science. However, the transition from simple ideas to intricate schemes of low-level logic and assembly instructions can be a bit abrupt. For those not deeply into tech, some sections might seem overwhelming – it’s okay to skip a few pages.

As a telecommunication engineer (as its written in my diploma), I found this journey back to my university days, revisiting electric circuits and digital processors, extremely enriching. The book brilliantly ties together various concepts, showing their interconnections and evolution.

One aspect, though, felt confusing – the 'difficulty curve' of the book. It's like a rollercoaster, swinging from basic to 'wow, this is tough.' It made me think: could this material be restructured into a more traditional, gradual 'saw' difficulty curve typical in game design? It's fascinating to view literature through a game designer's lens, always considering how to balance challenge and learning progression.

Have you ever noticed how the books you read and the games you play sometimes intersect in fascinating ways? I recently talked about the book "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software," this weekend, I stumbled upon the game "Signal State" in my digital library. "Signal State" is a puzzle game that challenges players to solve problems using a variety of modules and wires, mimicking the principles of signal processing. It's an ideal companion to the book, offering a hands-on experience with concepts similar to low-level programming.

The game's mechanics, involving modules and wires, are reminiscent of low-level programming, yet they encourage thinking in unconventional paradigms. If you're familiar with creating digital signal processing schemas, you might find "Signal State" more intuitive. The inclusion of wires in the game adds an extra layer of complexity. I often sketched simplified block diagrams on a notepad to keep up.

While playing, I pondered whether modern programmers need such games and knowledge. In an era where high-level languages and frameworks dominate, why bother with this "sacred knowledge"? Why delve into the basics when tools like GPT can generate code on command? There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer, but I've found that understanding these foundational concepts greatly benefits my programming career. It keeps my mind agile and frees me from being confined to standard programming paradigms. Grasping how things work at a fundamental level can liberate us from the 'cargo cult' mentality, where developers follow the rules without really understanding why.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Do you think games like "Signal State" are essential for understanding the basics of programming and breaking free from conventional thinking? Share your experiences, and let's discuss!
