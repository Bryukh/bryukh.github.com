Our first LAN in university is forever tied to Heroes of Might and Magic 3 in my memory. I remember how we discussed strategies and analyzed every match. We had deeper debates about which faction was better and more complex math calculations than we ever had in our classes. And let's not forget the intricate spreadsheets for building calculations and strategies in Diablo 2. Then we discovered Colobot and tried to figure out how to compete there—but sadly, there was no multiplayer in that programming game. 20 years later, I'm making games where you can compete with your programming and problem-solving skills.

The main issue with most STEM-related competitions is that they're not exciting for spectators—and often not even for participants. They can feel like exams on steroids, making it hard to convince students that these kids are superstars. Competition in classrooms can be a double-edged sword if it just turns into a race for grades. It needs to be fun and engaging, not just about who's the best.

We've already seen how geeks and nerds became popular—through video games and esports. Twenty years ago, pulling all-nighters playing Quake earned you a "nerd" label. Now, it's a ticket to being the coolest in class. While esports might not be at the peak of its hype this year, maybe this is exactly the right time to use it as a motivation for learning. Esports competitions feel normal now, making it much easier to bring them into schools. If video games could turn nerds into rockstars, maybe esports-inspired competitions can make STEM learning just as thrilling.
