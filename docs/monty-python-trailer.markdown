YouTube threw me a curveball today with a recommendation for the "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" trailer! Yes, the iconic film is making a triumphant return to cinemas. If you're in any media-related industry, particularly game development, and haven't watched this masterpiece, it's a must-see. The gigantic volume of references to "The Holy Grail" sprinkled throughout video games is staggering. A bright memory from my childhood is the Battle Chess game, where I was surprised by the unusual animation of the white knight defeating the black knight. Only years later, I got it and realized it was a nod to this classic film. Now, every time I stumble upon a "new" meme or reference rooted in a scene from this legendary movie, I can't help but chuckle. So, if you're looking for a blend of nostalgia and timeless humor, there's no better reason to head to the cinema and relive this immortal classic. Check out the trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b52A3sKz-I
