Having been immersed in the gaming world for over 35 years, I've seen the evolution of many #gamedev companies.
But my connection with Epic has a special place in my heart.
I remember when the first Unreal game was launched - it was a game-changer for me.
While I was not caught in Quake PvP and Counter-Strike during my dormitory days,
Unreal truly captivated me. I can't even begin to count the hours I dedicated to those intense Death Match battles.

Fast forward a bit, and along came Infinity Blade. What a revolutionary game that was at the time of its release! Gears of War followed, leaving an indelible mark on my gaming journey. As I transitioned into the Game Development industry, I was introduced to the wonders of the Unreal Engine. Admittedly, I hopped onto the Fortnite bandwagon when it was already a sensation, enjoying several seasons and revisiting it occasionally. Hearing about the recent layoffs as Epic transitions to V5.0 is disheartening. But in my eyes, Epic remains a monumental force that has continually shaped the gaming industry.

For those interested in a deeper dive into Epic's history, I highly recommend this article on Polygon by Brian Crecente. It's a testament to the company's enduring legacy and influence.
