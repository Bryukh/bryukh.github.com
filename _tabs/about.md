My name is Valentin Briukhanov and I'm a game designer and programmer.

I create educational and programming games for kids and experienced programmers. I am passionate about game design, programming, and education. I believe that games can be used to teach people of all ages about programming or any other subject. I am also passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.
