Hi, I’m Valentin Briukhanov — a game developer, designer, and software engineer who loves blending technology, storytelling, and learning through play.

With over a decade in game development and two decades in software engineering, I’ve been crafting games that teach, challenge, and inspire. From designing engaging coding challenges at CheckiO to leading development at CodeCombat, my work focuses on turning education into an interactive experience. Whether it's building an MMORPG to teach coding, designing game-based learning mechanics, or experimenting with how games can enhance skill-building, I thrive at the intersection of gameplay, problem-solving, and innovation.

I write about game development, game-based learning, and the craft of designing engaging experiences—whether it’s breaking down mechanics, exploring how games can teach, or sharing lessons learned from real projects. My blog is a mix of deep dives, experiments, and practical insights from years of working on educational games and interactive learning.

If you’re into game dev, game-based learning, or how games can make education more engaging, stick around—I’m always exploring new ideas, sharing insights, and discussing what makes games a powerful tool for learning.
