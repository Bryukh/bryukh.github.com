My name is Valentin Briukhanov and I'm a game designer and programmer.

Game Development Leader with over 10 years in game development and over 20 years of experience in software development and IT. As a key developer at CodeCombat, I’ve crafted engaging, educational games that teach coding to a global audience, impacting over 10,000 students and educators. 

My portfolio includes CodeCombat Worlds, an MMORPG for learning, and AILeague, a coding esport experience, both designed to inspire and equip learners through immersive gameplay. With expertise in Roblox development and a proven ability to enhance code maintainability—such as migrating legacy codebases from CoffeeScript to JavaScript—I bring strong skills in game design, multiplayer coding challenges, and full-stack development. I am passionate about advancing educational experiences through innovative, interactive games.
