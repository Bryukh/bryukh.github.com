My name is Valentin Briukhanov and I'm a game director/developer/designer and software engineer.

As a key developer at CodeCombat, I’ve crafted engaging, educational games that teach coding to a global audience, impacting over 10,000 students and educators.

My portfolio includes CodeCombat Worlds, an MMORPG for learning, and AILeague, a coding esport experience, both designed to inspire and equip learners through immersive gameplay. With expertise in Roblox development and a proven ability to enhance code maintainability—such as migrating legacy codebases from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. In CheckIO I've created hundreds of coding challenges for learners to solve and improve their skills. 

I bring strong skills in game design, multiplayer coding challenges, and full-stack development. 

I am passionate about game development, educational games, software engineering, using AI for game development and education.
